Overview of Functions in views.py
The views.py file in the JobSphere project contains several key functions that handle the logic for various routes in the application. These functions facilitate user interactions by managing requests and returning appropriate responses.

1. Job List View
This function retrieves and displays a list of all available job postings. It queries the database for job entries and renders them in a template, allowing users to browse through the available opportunities.

2. Job Detail View
This function is responsible for displaying detailed information about a specific job posting. It fetches the job based on a unique identifier and presents its attributes, such as title, description, and requirements, in a dedicated template.

3. Job Create View
This function handles the creation of new job postings. It processes incoming data from a form submitted by the user. If the data is valid, it saves the new job entry to the database and redirects the user to the job list or detail page.

4. Job Update View
This function allows users to edit existing job postings. It retrieves the job entry to be updated and pre-fills a form with its current details. Upon submission, it validates the updated data and saves the changes to the database.

5. Job Delete View
This function manages the deletion of job postings. It confirms the user's intention to delete a specific job entry and, upon confirmation, removes it from the database. It typically redirects users back to the job list after the deletion.

6. User Authentication Views
These functions handle user login, logout, and registration processes. They manage user sessions and ensure that users can securely access their accounts and perform actions based on their authentication status.
